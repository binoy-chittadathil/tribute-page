        <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
        <ul>
  <li><span>1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>
  <li><span>1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br> to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li><br>
  <li><span>1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>
  <li><span>1937</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li><br>
  <li><span>1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under<br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>
  <li><span>1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li><br>
  <li><span>1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
  <li><span>1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>
  <li><span>1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat<br> yields</li><br>
  <li><span>1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to<br> fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
  <li><span>1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population</li><br>
  <li><span>1970</span> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>
  <li><span>1983</span> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br> sorghum yields</li><br>
  <li><span>1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
  <li><span>2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li><br>
  <li><span>2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
